# Precision-Agriculture-using-Machine-Learning-and-Image-Processing
The “smart field program” is based on accurate agricultural sensors for real-
time monitoring, and multilevel analysis using cloud computing, machine
learning and image processing. It improves the ability of agricultural
production to respond to natural environmental risks and turn
disadvantaged traditional agriculture into a highly efficient modern
agriculture.
